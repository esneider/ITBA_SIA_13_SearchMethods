This package contains the original Programmer's Minesweeper from:

  http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/ramsdell/pgms/

modified to add additional features needed by Chris Studholme for a class
project in Constraint Satisfaction Problems.  In the src directory, you will
find a package called csp that contains CSPStrategy.  For more information
about this strategy, see:

  http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~cvs/minesweeper/

The changes to PGMS itself are not very well documented.  Run PGMS with the -h
option to get a listing of the supported options (including the new ones).  

A compiled version of the original PGMS (w/o CSPStrategy) is in pgms.jar.  The
file pgms-csp.jar has a compiled version of the modified PGMS with CSPStrategy.
To see an expert game with CSPStrategy with standard rules, run:

  java -jar pgms-csp.jar -e -R -s csp.CSPStrategy

Any questions about the modifications to PGMS can be emailed to:

  cvs@cs.utoronto.ca

Questions about the original PGMS code should be emailed to the author of that
code (see the web page at the top of this file).

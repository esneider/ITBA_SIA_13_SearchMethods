/**
 * Class to represent a single constraint.  A constraint consists of a bunch
 * of boolean variables (0 or 1) summed together on one side of an equal
 * sign with an integer constant on the other side.  The number of variables
 * will usually be in the range 1 to 8 and thus the constant should also be 
 * in this range.  
 *
 * Two special cases: if the constant is 0, all variables must be 0; and if 
 * the constant equals the number of variables, all variables must be 1.
 *
 * Every clear board position will have one constraint associated with it.  
 * The method BoardPosition.newConstraint() should be used to automatically
 * construct these constraints.  A constraint is usually "thrown away" once
 * all its variables are known (either 0 or 1).
